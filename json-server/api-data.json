Arthur suffers from a neurological disorder that causes him to laugh uncontrollably at inappropriate times, requiring medication, for which he depends on social services. After Arthur is attacked by juvenile delinquents, his co-worker Randall gives him a revolver for self-defense. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie, and invites her to see his routine at Pogo's comedy club. At a children's hospital, Arthur is fired when his revolver is exposed. Depressed on the subway, still in clown makeup, Arthur witnessed drunk businessmen harassing a woman, and then is beaten by the drunk businessmen from Wayne Investments; he shoots and kills two of them in self-defense and murders the third as he attempts to flee. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, who calls his political opponents clowns. Protesters react by donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Budget cuts shut down the social service program, leaving Arthur without medication.",
